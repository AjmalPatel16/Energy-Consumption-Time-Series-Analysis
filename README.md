________________________________________
Steps in How a Website Works:
1. User Requests a Website
‚Ä¢	The user enters the website‚Äôs URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in a web browser (e.g., www.google.com).
‚Ä¢	The browser sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) to find the website‚Äôs IP address.
2. DNS Resolves the Domain Name
‚Ä¢	The DNS server converts the domain name into an IP address, which identifies the website‚Äôs hosting server.
‚Ä¢	The browser connects to this IP address to request the website's content.
3. Server Processes the Request
‚Ä¢	The request reaches the web server, which stores the website‚Äôs files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
‚Ä¢	If the website is static, the server sends the pre-designed web pages to the browser.
‚Ä¢	If the website is dynamic, the server processes the request using backend programming languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) and retrieves data from a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
4. Website Content is Sent to the Browser
‚Ä¢	The server responds by sending the requested web pages to the user's browser.
‚Ä¢	The browser interprets and renders the files (HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity).
5. Website is Displayed on the User‚Äôs Screen
‚Ä¢	The browser displays the web page with text, images, videos, and interactive elements.
‚Ä¢	The user can navigate between pages by clicking links, submitting forms, or interacting with buttons.
________________________________________
Example of How a Website Works:
1.	User types www.amazon.com in the browser.
2.	The browser requests the domain name from a DNS server.
3.	The Amazon web server processes the request and retrieves product data from a database.
4.	The browser receives the webpage and displays it to the user.
________________________________________
Conclusion:
A website works by following a structured process where the browser, DNS, web server, and database communicate to deliver content to users. This interaction happens within seconds, ensuring a smooth user experience.
